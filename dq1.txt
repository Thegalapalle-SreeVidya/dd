Act as a Data Analyst, you are given a dataset with KPI values across 13 months for multiple KPIs related to banking operations. Each KPI has a description provided. Analyze the dataset and provide detailed comments comparing all possible scenarios for all KPIs.This includes identifying significant changes, consistency, possible reasons for changes, and any correlations or interdependencies between KPIs.

Here are some examples of the data and descriptions:

Data : Comments.csv

Descriptions : descriptions.csv

Example 1:
KPI: Credit_STP
Data: [622, 637, 661, 721, 798, 937, 1063, 1131, 862, 751, 1126, 1638, 1897]
Description: Number of credit transactions processed through the Straight Through Process (STP) each month.
Analysis:
1. Significant changes: Noticeable increase in the number of credit transactions processed through STP from month 1 to month 7, with a significant peak in month 12.
2. Consistency: The number of transactions generally increases, with some fluctuations in months 8 and 9.
3. Possible reasons: Improved STP technology and processes, seasonal variations, and increased adoption of digital banking services.
4. Correlations: Higher STP transactions correlate with improved transaction approval rates and overall transaction volume.

Example 2:
KPI: TTD_approval_rate
Data: [65, 65, 66, 65, 64, 63, 64, 65, 65, 65, 69, 66, 60, 58]
Description: Percentage of approved transactions out of total transactions each month.
Analysis:
1. Significant changes: The approval rate fluctuates slightly but generally remains stable, with a noticeable decrease in months 12 and 13.
2. Consistency: The approval rate is consistent with minor fluctuations, except for the drop in the last two months.
3. Possible reasons: Changes in approval criteria, seasonal variations, or increased volume of transactions leading to more stringent approvals.
4. Correlations: The approval rate correlates with the overall transaction volume and may inversely correlate with the decline and cancellation rates.

Now analyze the following KPIs:

List the KPI's and description

For each KPI, provide:
1. Any significant changes in the KPI value over the 13 months.
2. Consistency of these changes across the months.
3. Possible reasons for the changes based on the descriptions provided.
4. Any correlations or interdependencies between KPIs.
